# smooth-explorer

This is a relatively simple plugin for Obsidian that allows you to browse or navigate the file explorer using the up and down arrow keys, opening the files as you go.  

KEY FEATURES

### File Explorer Navigation:  
• `ArrowUp/ArrowDown`: Navigate up and down the file explorer, opening the selected File Explorer item in the most recently active leaf with no further keystrokes needed.  
• `ArrowUp/ArrowDown + Shift`: Open the selected File Explorer item in a new tab.  
• `ArrowUp/ArrowDown + Alt/Opt`: Navigate the file explorer without opening files.  
• `Alt/Opt + Enter`: Open the currently focused File Explorer item in the most recently active tab. (Note: `Command/Control + Enter` is the default key combo for opening selected File Explorer items, however opening items this way will bypass the plugin's features, such as preventing duplicated leaves and preserving the focus on the File Explorer.)
• `Alt/Opt + Shift + Enter`: Open the currently focused File Explorer item in a new tab.

### Other Notes:
• Already open files will not be duplicated.  
• Folders are ignored, but if you are using a folder index plugin of some sort (i.e., if the folder includes a file named "index.md" or has the same name as the folder itself), the index file will be loaded.
